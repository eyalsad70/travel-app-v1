This is my first travel app version that gives customer valuable travel information (attractions of different types, hotels and restaurant) on requested destinations around the world
this app is accessed via Telegram BOT and can be used by multiple users simultanously.

the project has some prequisistes (as it requires access keys/tokens for API usage), which are defined in help.txt file
the requirements.txt file includes the python libraries that needs to be installed

project-files.ini shows the list of files used in this project, and more description for each pythonfile can be found in the file itself

in case you want to test this app before adding access keys & tokens, I have added a database of different locations under the ./data folder. 
you still need the telegram token (which you will get when you create a new BOT pn telegram)

Enjoy!
